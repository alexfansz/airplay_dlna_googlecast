# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# This file is no longer maintained and is not used by new (2.2+) versions of the
# Android plugin for Gradle. Instead, the Android plugin for Gradle generates the
# default rules at build time and stores them in the build directory.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.

# For more details, see

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
